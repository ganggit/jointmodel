This file provides the joint model for denoising and classification using deep learning.
It contains the following files:
(1) the two noise models, mentioned in the paper
(2) backpropagation function, JOINT_BACK_CG_4LAYER.m
To make it run, the user shold download the thirdparty toolbox: Autoencoder from Hinton:
